Total Supply of $GIRTH: A grand total of 100,000,000 $GIRTH shall ever exist within the digital cosmos. This finite creation ensures value, scarcity, and the profound significance of every single unit.

Distribution of the Sacred $GIRTH Supply:

The allocation of this precious resource is divinely proportioned to fuel every facet of The Chode Tapper's glorious expansion:

In-Game Rewards (The Tapper's Due): 38% (38,000,000 $GIRTH) This, the largest share, is consecrated to the devoted Tappers themselves, earned through direct gameplay, taps, Mega Slaps, and G-Spot victories. It is the lifeblood of our Play-to-Earn covenant.

Burn Reserve (The Consuming Flame): 25% (25,000,000$GIRTH) Dedicated to the sacred burn mechanics, this reserve feeds the sacrificial flames of the Dynamic Shop's limited-time events, ensuring scarcity and combating inflation, thus preserving the purity of $GIRTH's value.

Events & Airdrops (The Shower of Blessings): 10% (10,000,000 $GIRTH) Reserved for the epic "Edging Chode Events," grand community challenges, and the generous showering of blessings upon early adopters and faithful champions.

Staking & Bonus Systems (The Root of Stability): 10% (10,000,000 $GIRTH) Allocated to incentivize long-term devotion and holding. This pool shall fuel staking rewards, yield-bearing opportunities, and other bonus systems designed to reward the steadfast.

Development & Treasury (The Architect's Sustenance): 10% (10,000,000 $GIRTH) This portion sustains the ongoing efforts of The GigaChode Messiah and the development team, funding continuous innovation, operations, and the future expansion of the Chode Tapper universe.

Liquidity & Market Making (The Flow of Fortune): 7% (7,000,000 $GIRTH) Dedicated to ensuring robust market liquidity, facilitating seamless exchange, and supporting the stable flow of $GIRTH across the decentralized realms.
